<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a beginner web developer who has recently completed learning HTML and taken my first steps into web development. I enjoy creating simple, clean webpage structures and understanding how websites are built from the ground up. I am now preparing to continue with CSS and JavaScript so I can turn my ideas into fully functional and responsive projects. Even though I am just starting, I am motivated to grow my skills and become a confident full-stack developer</p>
